### 1. Introduction
The idea for this project came about due to the need for a more interactive solution in the e-commerce industry, especially in the sale of products that generally require hands-on inspection, such as watches. By using Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) technology, this app gives users the experience to try on various watch models in a way that is real and close to the hands-on experience.

### 2. Tech Stack
- **Unity 3D**: Game engine that provides a development environment for creating our applications, including graphic design, animation, and resource management.

- **Vuforia**: Augmented Reality (AR) platform integrated with Unity, enabling surface detection and tracking to place the watch model in a real environment.

- **C#**: Programming language in application development to control application behavior, including user interaction and data management.

- **DF360**: Unity package for implement reflections and lighting to make objects more realistic.
